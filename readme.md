# TSOBot
This is a notification bot for TeamSpeak 3 servers. It sends a notification via Telegram once new users join a specific TS3 server.

## Installation
1. Before installing TSBot, make sure to set the right *b_virtualserver_notify_register* for guests on you TS3 server.

2. Create a new Telegram bot by sending a message to @Botfather in Telegram. He'll send you your Bot API key and gives you all information you need to run your bot. You'll find further information concerning bots at [Telegram].

3. TSOBot utilizes MongoDB to store active subscriptions. Therefore a running MongoDB instance is mandatory. Download and install it from [here].

4. Go ahead and install TSOBot via npm:

    ```
    npm install tsobot
    ```

5. Navigate to the folder of the newly installed TSOBot module. Create a new ```settings.json``` file by copying the existing ```settingsExample.json``` and fill it with your personal settings:

  * **botApiKey**: You'll receive this from Telegrams @Botfather.
  * **mongooseConnection**: Connection string for your MongoDB database.
  * **server**: IP or hostname of your TS3 server.
  * **port**: TS3 server port. If empty, default port will be used (9987).
  * **queryPort**: TS3 ServerQuery port. If empty, default port will be used

6. Run ```npm start``` in context of your node_modules/tsobot folder to start the bot.
